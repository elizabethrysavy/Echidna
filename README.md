# Echidna
#The Echidna is a backpack for extreme hikers, rescue workers, and other people who may spend large amounts of time alone in the wilderness
#It includes sensors to detect if the wearer is in danger (temperature, heart rate, fall detection, etc.)
#If it detects danger, backpack sets of an alarm, which the wearer has time to turn off in case of false reading
#If alarm not turned off in time, Echidna sends out an SOS signal with the wearer's GPS coordinates over radio waves
#This way, the wearer can hopefully get any help they need
